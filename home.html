    <p> The goal of this assignment was to perform an A/B test, collect data and conduct a statistical analysis to gather insight on two different UI designs.
      I have included a link to the webpages I used to conduct the A/B test above. For these pages, I made relatively minor UI changes, mostly stylistic and mostly dealing with the visual appearance and organization of the page.s
      Versison A was the edited page while version B was the original template given in class.

<!-- <p><span class="w3-tag">Questions</span> <ul> -->
  <li class="padding4">My alternate hypothesis for both metrics is informed by the changes I made to the HTML layout.  </li>
  <li class="padding4">In Version B, everything wasnâ€™t centered which made flow and overall presentation not as clear and fluid. </li>
  <li class="padding4"> In Version A, the cacti images, add to cart and shopping cart features were all centered on the page. </li>
  <li class="padding4">Additionally, there was a difference between the title and the content of the page in terms of color. </li>
  <li class="padding4">This delineation of content makes it more clear to the user which section they will most likely be completing tasks in (I think). </li>
  <li class="padding4">As a result, if tasks they are meant to complete are easier to see in Version A, time to completion will be shorter and there will be a difference in return rate (in favor of Version A).
 </li>

  <!-- <li class="padding8">Time to Completion:
	<li>Null: There is no difference in time to completion between Version A and Version B (Version A is not better than Version B).</li>
	Alternative: Version A is better than Version B (less time to complete task)
 </li>
  <li>There is not any established layout hierarchy, something even more emphasized as the different web pages are navigated through. </li>
  <li>There is some sort of box model utilized, but again, is not consistent throughout the website. This makes some content very difficult to read or even find. </li>
  <li>Buttons in the navigation bar appear to be part of the image; it took me a while to realize that there was an actual navigation bar there especially after having to go through so much to get to the main page. </li>
  <li>There was also some issues with the text displaying, where the text is just not showing up on the correct spot or on top of other text. </li>

<DD><li>Null: There is no difference in time to completion between Version A and Version B (Version A is not better than Version B).</li>

<DT>Data Collection Process
<DD><li>As outlined in class, the link was sent out to classmates.</li>
<DD><li>However, I didn't have nearly enough data points (nowehere near 40), so I sent my link to friends and classmates from other classes. </li>
<li> Regardless of which version of the pages a user received, their task was to fill their cart with at least $150 worth of cacti/succulents</li>
